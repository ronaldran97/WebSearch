Information Retrieval is the correct term
- it is the field concerned with the structure, analysis, organization, storage, searching, and retrieval of information

History
- the idea of using computers to search for information dates back to as early as 1945
- Long history of search engines in digital libraries, creating the academic field of information retrieval
- early web search engines
    - JumpStation (1993)
        - first www resource-discovery tool to combiine the three essential features of the modern web search engine
    - Lycos (1994)
    - AltaVista (1995)
    - Yahoo (1995)
- in 1996, grad students at Stanford, Larry Page and Sergey Brin began workign on a crawler. They incorprated as Google Inc. in 1998. By 2000 they had added 1 billion urls 

    Prior to Web Search
    - before search engines, there was no capacity to search teh entire WWW, we used directories 
    - yahoo started as a directory

Core Issues
- everything was on text and documents in the 50s
- example documents
    - web pages, email, books, news, scholarly papers, text messages, Word, PowerPoint, PDF, forum postings, patents. IM sessions, etc.
- Common Properties
    - significant text ontent
    - some structure
- DataBases
    - Database Records (tuples) are typically made up of well-defined fields (or attributes)
        - bank records with account numbers, balances, names, addresses, social security numbers...
    - you had to be specific when searching
- comparing text
    - comparing the query text to the document text and determining what is a good match is the core issue of information retrieval
    - exact matching of word is not enough
    - ideally you get what you want, even if the query is bad
